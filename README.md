# PIC18F4550 Dev-Education Board

This project is a development and education board based on the Microchip PIC18F4550,
designed for both teaching and real firmware development using MPLAB X and the XC8 compiler.

The board provides access to the main peripherals of the PIC18 architecture and is intended
for hands-on learning at register level, without hiding details behind high-level libraries.

## Main Features

- Microcontroller: PIC18F4550
- USB interface (CDC / HID capable)
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
- Timers and interrupts
- PWM outputs
- Digital I/O
- On-board clock circuitry
- Regulated power supply
- ICSP programming/debug support

## Firmware

All firmware examples are written in:
- MPLAB X IDE
- XC8 compiler

Each peripheral has a dedicated test project, focused on clarity and didactic value.

## Hardware Documentation

- Block diagram (PDF)
- Full schematics (PDF)

## Target Audience

- Engineering and technical students
- Educators
- Embedded systems developers and hobbyists
- Anyone interested in low-level PIC microcontroller programming

## Status

Documentation and firmware examples are being organized and published.
