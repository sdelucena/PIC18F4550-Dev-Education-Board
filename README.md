# PIC18F4550 Dev-Education Board

![LV62 PIC18F4550 Dev-Education Board](hardware/board_photos/LV62_Overview_Multiple_Boards.jpg)

This project is a development and education board based on the Microchip PIC18F4550,
designed for both teaching and real firmware development using MPLAB X and the XC8 compiler.

The board provides access to the main peripherals of the PIC18 architecture and is intended
for hands-on learning at register level, without hiding details behind high-level libraries.

## Main Features

- Microcontroller: PIC18F4550
- USB interface (CDC / HID capable)
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
- Timers and interrupts
- PWM outputs
- Digital I/O
- On-board clock circuitry
- Regulated power supply
- ICSP programming/debug support

## Firmware

All firmware examples are written in:
- MPLAB X IDE
- XC8 compiler

Each peripheral has a dedicated test project, focused on clarity and didactic value.
